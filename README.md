## How to run the program

Requirements: the "nightly" version of the compiler

To generate code and test it, run

```
cargo run -- [FLAGS]
```

For more information on different flags available, run 

```
cargo run -- --help
```

## Progress

Can generate a fair amount of syntactically correct programs.

The program is able to correctly handle types and ownership. The main remaining class of illegal programs being generated is due to the program not handling multiple things having the same name properly. For example, it might generate function signatures with multiple parameters named the same thing (which is illegal). It might also attempt to reference a variable somewhere else that has been shadowed by another variable. Stack overflows also happen occasionally when generating programs. Both of these things happen about once or twice every 10Â 000 programs

An (incomplete) list of missing language features:
    * If/else and match
    * loops
    * type synonyms
    * modules and `use`
    * unsafe code
        - unions
        - pointers
    * Generics for structs
    * Early returns from functions
    * Blocks, if/else and so on in the middle of expressions
